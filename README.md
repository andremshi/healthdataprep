The HealthDataPrep is an innovative framework developed for the efficient preparation of structured and semi-structured data in the healthcare domain, with a focus on its application in unsupervised learning models. In the specific context of the research, the framework was applied to a mortality database related to Alzheimer's disease.

We employed the K-modes algorithm for categorical data clustering and the identification of profiles among those deceased due to the disease, providing a deeper understanding of the characteristics associated with these specific cases.

Additionally, the Apriori algorithm, a rule association mining technique, was utilized to analyze and identify patterns related to other causes of death that occurred in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease. This approach led to significant discoveries about the relationships between different health conditions, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the disease's impact.
